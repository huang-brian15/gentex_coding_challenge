# gentex_coding_challenge

The coding_challenge.cs script takes an input CSV file, parses the data of each shape, 
and outputs to a new CSV file containing the area and perimeter of that shape.

To run the script, you must specify an input file path (CSV file to parse) and an output file path on the command line.
